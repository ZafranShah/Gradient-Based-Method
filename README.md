# Gradient-Based-Method

This method is developed to create adversarial images in Support Vector Machines. 

1. GradientBaseMethodSVM module will generate the adversarial inputs in SVM. Initially, the handwritten digits dataset is more suitable to    validate this method.

2. TestAdversarialInputs module can be used to predict and verify the adversarial inputs by using the trained SVM Model.
